./origem/partes/parte_0001.mp4;Thank you for watching.
./origem/partes/parte_0002.mp4;Thank you for watching.
./origem/partes/parte_0003.mp4;What changed my life wasn't a day, but a night.
./origem/partes/parte_0004.mp4;It was Halloween night.
./origem/partes/parte_0005.mp4;I was Buffalo Bob, and I had the real cowhide vest.
./origem/partes/parte_0006.mp4;It was 1960, and I lived in Holden, Kentucky.
./origem/partes/parte_0007.mp4;I loved Zagnut bars, and my sister Ellen loved Baby Ruth bars.
./origem/partes/parte_0008.mp4;My brother Tugga loved everything.
./origem/partes/parte_0009.mp4;I don't love Halloween anymore.
./origem/partes/parte_0010.mp4;It was the night my mom, my brother, and my sister was murdered with a hammer.
./origem/partes/parte_0011.mp4;I remember the blood smelled like pennies.
./origem/partes/parte_0012.mp4;I remember the blood smelled like pennies.
./origem/partes/parte_0013.mp4;I remember the blood smelled like pennies.
./origem/partes/parte_0014.mp4;My father killed everyone but me.
./origem/partes/parte_0015.mp4;I don't like to remember it, but I can't forget it.
./origem/partes/parte_0016.mp4;The end.
./origem/partes/parte_0017.mp4;The end.
./origem/partes/parte_0018.mp4;I know it isn't very long.
./origem/partes/parte_0020.mp4;Harry, that's a powerful story.
./origem/partes/parte_0021.mp4;Thank you for sharing that with us.
./origem/partes/parte_0022.mp4;And why was this good?
./origem/partes/parte_0023.mp4;Because when we heard it, we knew him.
./origem/partes/parte_0024.mp4;It was honest.
./origem/partes/parte_0025.mp4;What Harry wrote was very painful.
./origem/partes/parte_0026.mp4;The truth probably made us all feel a little uncomfortable.
./origem/partes/parte_0027.mp4;Because of that, it was...
./origem/partes/parte_0029.mp4;It was very powerful.
./origem/partes/parte_0030.mp4;Let me see that.
./origem/partes/parte_0031.mp4;Boom.
./origem/partes/parte_0032.mp4;Harry, hey.
./origem/partes/parte_0033.mp4;Tell us. Tell us something.
./origem/partes/parte_0034.mp4;Never got an A-plus before.
./origem/partes/parte_0035.mp4;Well, congratulations.
./origem/partes/parte_0036.mp4;Can I ask you a question?
./origem/partes/parte_0037.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0038.mp4;I'm going for a promotion.
./origem/partes/parte_0039.mp4;Can you write a letter to the principal?
./origem/partes/parte_0040.mp4;Only if you promise to give me a raise as soon as you're running this place.
./origem/partes/parte_0041.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0042.mp4;All right.
./origem/partes/parte_0043.mp4;See ya.
./origem/partes/parte_0044.mp4;Bye.
./origem/partes/parte_0045.mp4;It's not a Pilates class in the world
./origem/partes/parte_0046.mp4;that's gonna help you if you keep eating like that.
./origem/partes/parte_0047.mp4;Thanks for worrying about my ass.
./origem/partes/parte_0048.mp4;Why don't you put a diet burger on the menu?
./origem/partes/parte_0049.mp4;I do make a diet burger.
./origem/partes/parte_0050.mp4;It's called a salad.
./origem/partes/parte_0051.mp4;Where?
./origem/partes/parte_0052.mp4;His eyes were like two round, blue circles
./origem/partes/parte_0053.mp4;with another black circle in the middle.
./origem/partes/parte_0054.mp4;Well, you know, every once in a while,
./origem/partes/parte_0055.mp4;you get a young Ernest Hemingway, don't you?
./origem/partes/parte_0056.mp4;Every once in a while, someone gives me a $10 tip.
./origem/partes/parte_0057.mp4;Hmm.
./origem/partes/parte_0058.mp4;We both have a lot to look forward to.
./origem/partes/parte_0059.mp4;Hey, Christy.
./origem/partes/parte_0060.mp4;Hi.
./origem/partes/parte_0061.mp4;How are you?
./origem/partes/parte_0062.mp4;You look good.
./origem/partes/parte_0063.mp4;Thank you, Al.
./origem/partes/parte_0064.mp4;Want a bite?
./origem/partes/parte_0065.mp4;It's $1.25.
./origem/partes/parte_0066.mp4;That can't be real beef.
./origem/partes/parte_0067.mp4;You're missing out.
./origem/partes/parte_0068.mp4;I wrote to Helene when I heard about your dad.
./origem/partes/parte_0069.mp4;Did you get a chance to talk to him before?
./origem/partes/parte_0070.mp4;He died when I was on the plane to see him.
./origem/partes/parte_0071.mp4;I'm sorry.
./origem/partes/parte_0072.mp4;There's three sets to sign.
./origem/partes/parte_0073.mp4;One for you.
./origem/partes/parte_0074.mp4;One for me.
./origem/partes/parte_0075.mp4;One for the lawyer.
./origem/partes/parte_0076.mp4;Need a pen?
./origem/partes/parte_0077.mp4;I signed already.
./origem/partes/parte_0078.mp4;Great.
./origem/partes/parte_0079.mp4;Always prepared.
./origem/partes/parte_0080.mp4;You doing any writing these days?
./origem/partes/parte_0081.mp4;Nope.
./origem/partes/parte_0082.mp4;I always loved your writing.
./origem/partes/parte_0083.mp4;There you go.
./origem/partes/parte_0084.mp4;Believe it or not, I'm not.
./origem/partes/parte_0085.mp4;I wish you all the best.
./origem/partes/parte_0086.mp4;Christy.
./origem/partes/parte_0087.mp4;I wish you the best, too.
./origem/partes/parte_0088.mp4;Al?
./origem/partes/parte_0089.mp4;Get out of here.
./origem/partes/parte_0090.mp4;Al, you all right?
./origem/partes/parte_0091.mp4;Just go home.
./origem/partes/parte_0092.mp4;You OK?
./origem/partes/parte_0093.mp4;Jesus Christ.
./origem/partes/parte_0094.mp4;What happened to you?
./origem/partes/parte_0095.mp4;I'm fine.
./origem/partes/parte_0096.mp4;You're not fine.
./origem/partes/parte_0097.mp4;You look like crap.
./origem/partes/parte_0098.mp4;Go on.
./origem/partes/parte_0099.mp4;What the hell's going on?
./origem/partes/parte_0100.mp4;What happened to you?
./origem/partes/parte_0101.mp4;Oh, shit.

./origem/partes/parte_0137.mp4;physicist.
./origem/partes/parte_0138.mp4;Go away, ker-ko.
./origem/partes/parte_0139.mp4;SPEAKER 3 In Hook's questo!
./origem/partes/parte_0140.mp4;Matteo Pirac.
./origem/partes/parte_0141.mp4;Incorrect.
./origem/partes/parte_0142.mp4;AL Watkins.
./origem/partes/parte_0143.mp4;You sound fine.
./origem/partes/parte_0144.mp4;Now, you want to tell me what the fuck is going on?
./origem/partes/parte_0145.mp4;Aaron, what's going on is cancer.
./origem/partes/parte_0146.mp4;Al, you got cancer in five minutes?
./origem/partes/parte_0147.mp4;Oh, I'm tired.
./origem/partes/parte_0148.mp4;Do me a favor.
./origem/partes/parte_0149.mp4;Close the door on your way out.
./origem/partes/parte_0150.mp4;Come over tomorrow.
./origem/partes/parte_0151.mp4;I'll explain.
./origem/partes/parte_0152.mp4;I'll explain everything.
./origem/partes/parte_0153.mp4;Go home.
./origem/partes/parte_0154.mp4;In the 1930s, researchers began experimenting with a number of so-called shock therapies
./origem/partes/parte_0155.mp4;meant to reroute the circuitry in the diseased brain.
./origem/partes/parte_0156.mp4;Patients were diagnosed with cancer.
./origem/partes/parte_0157.mp4;Patients were diagnosed with cancer.
./origem/partes/parte_0158.mp4;Patients were brought to the age of death through an intentional overdose of the hormone insulin.
./origem/partes/parte_0159.mp4;Others were given metronome, which triggered seizures.
./origem/partes/parte_0161.mp4;Why do we think the filmmakers chose to document these conditions?
./origem/partes/parte_0162.mp4;If you look at the patients' writings after this, they...
./origem/partes/parte_0163.mp4;People tend to think the important stories are wars, elections, political movements.
./origem/partes/parte_0164.mp4;But these people matter.
./origem/partes/parte_0165.mp4;Little things matter.
./origem/partes/parte_0166.mp4;All right, see you tomorrow. Bye, Jerry.
./origem/partes/parte_0170.mp4;What's holding your attention on this little screen?
./origem/partes/parte_0173.mp4;I could send you the clip if you want.
./origem/partes/parte_0174.mp4;No, we'd do that.
./origem/partes/parte_0175.mp4;All right, here we are.
./origem/partes/parte_0176.mp4;Ahem.
./origem/partes/parte_0177.mp4;How long have we known each other?
./origem/partes/parte_0178.mp4;10, 12 years.
./origem/partes/parte_0179.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0181.mp4;You trust me?
./origem/partes/parte_0182.mp4;Not really.
./origem/partes/parte_0183.mp4;I'm gonna tell you something that's gonna seem crazy.
./origem/partes/parte_0184.mp4;Okay.
./origem/partes/parte_0185.mp4;But, uh, before I do,
./origem/partes/parte_0186.mp4;I need you to go in this closet.
./origem/partes/parte_0187.mp4;Just go in there and take a look around.
./origem/partes/parte_0188.mp4;Stay as long as you need.
./origem/partes/parte_0189.mp4;And then come back.
./origem/partes/parte_0190.mp4;Then I'll tell you everything.
./origem/partes/parte_0191.mp4;You want me to go in the closet, look around, spend as much time as I need?
./origem/partes/parte_0192.mp4;I know I sound batshit, okay?
./origem/partes/parte_0194.mp4;But I thought about this, and it'll just be simpler if you go in like I'm asking.
./origem/partes/parte_0195.mp4;Go in the closet.
./origem/partes/parte_0196.mp4;Can you do me a goddamn favor and just walk into the fucking closets?
./origem/partes/parte_0198.mp4;I'm going, okay? Relax.
./origem/partes/parte_0199.mp4;All right, go in the closets.
./origem/partes/parte_0200.mp4;Better not be any spiders in here.
./origem/partes/parte_0201.mp4;Take a few steps forward.
./origem/partes/parte_0202.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0203.mp4;If I feel any cobwebs on my face...
./origem/partes/parte_0204.mp4;Just keep on.
./origem/partes/parte_0205.mp4;I can't see anything.
./origem/partes/parte_0206.mp4;Just a few more steps.
./origem/partes/parte_0207.mp4;You want me to keep going?
./origem/partes/parte_0208.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0209.mp4;Yep.
./origem/partes/parte_0210.mp4;Ow!
./origem/partes/parte_0211.mp4;Ow!
./origem/partes/parte_0212.mp4;Ow!
./origem/partes/parte_0213.mp4;Ow!
./origem/partes/parte_0214.mp4;Ow!
./origem/partes/parte_0215.mp4;There you go.
./origem/partes/parte_0216.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0217.mp4;I got it!
./origem/partes/parte_0218.mp4;Man!
./origem/partes/parte_0219.mp4;Hi.
./origem/partes/parte_0220.mp4;Hi.
./origem/partes/parte_0221.mp4;For the love of God.
./origem/partes/parte_0222.mp4;Hey, Lolo.
./origem/partes/parte_0223.mp4;Hey, Lolo.
./origem/partes/parte_0224.mp4;Hey, Lolo.
./origem/partes/parte_0225.mp4;I'm back to you.
./origem/partes/parte_0226.mp4;Yeah, I did.
./origem/partes/parte_0227.mp4;Oh, for the love of God.
./origem/partes/parte_0228.mp4;Oh, for the love of Mike.
./origem/partes/parte_0229.mp4;Oh, for the love of Mike.
./origem/partes/parte_0230.mp4;Oh!
./origem/partes/parte_0231.mp4;Oh!
./origem/partes/parte_0232.mp4;Oh!
./origem/partes/parte_0233.mp4;Here we go. Here we go.
./origem/partes/parte_0234.mp4;You shouldn't be here.
./origem/partes/parte_0235.mp4;You shouldn't be here.
./origem/partes/parte_0236.mp4;You hear me? Huh?
./origem/partes/parte_0237.mp4;You shouldn't be here!
./origem/partes/parte_0238.mp4;What the fuck was that?
./origem/partes/parte_0239.mp4;That was October 21st, 1960.
./origem/partes/parte_0240.mp4;No, it wasn't.
./origem/partes/parte_0241.mp4;Now you understand why I needed you to go in there.
./origem/partes/parte_0242.mp4;What are you saying? What are you saying? This is a...
./origem/partes/parte_0243.mp4;Hard to find the right words, I know.
./origem/partes/parte_0244.mp4;But you go through there, and it's 1960.
./origem/partes/parte_0245.mp4;You're saying this is a time portal?
./origem/partes/parte_0246.mp4;I call it a rabbit hole.
./origem/partes/parte_0247.mp4;How long's it been there?
./origem/partes/parte_0248.mp4;Since I had the diner.
./origem/partes/parte_0249.mp4;Who else knows about it?
./origem/partes/parte_0250.mp4;Just you.
./origem/partes/parte_0251.mp4;If I told anyone else about it, they might try to stop me.
./origem/partes/parte_0252.mp4;They'd try and stop you? What are you talking about?
./origem/partes/parte_0253.mp4;Al, why did you show this to me?
./origem/partes/parte_0254.mp4;I need you to do what I couldn't.
./origem/partes/parte_0255.mp4;I need you to go back there.
./origem/partes/parte_0256.mp4;To prevent the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
./origem/partes/parte_0257.mp4;You heard about the butterfly effect?
./origem/partes/parte_0258.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0259.mp4;All right.
./origem/partes/parte_0260.mp4;Do you think that if JFK lived, Robert Kennedy would have run for president? Seriously?
./origem/partes/parte_0261.mp4;It's doubtful.
./origem/partes/parte_0262.mp4;So?
./origem/partes/parte_0263.mp4;If Bobby doesn't run, that means no Sirhan Sirhan at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968.
./origem/partes/parte_0264.mp4;Save JFK, save his brother.
./origem/partes/parte_0265.mp4;And that's what I mean about the butterfly effect.
./origem/partes/parte_0266.mp4;The butterfly effect.
./origem/partes/parte_0267.mp4;Then there's Vietnam.
./origem/partes/parte_0268.mp4;Oh, okay.
./origem/partes/parte_0269.mp4;So if you save JFK, then there's no Vietnam?
./origem/partes/parte_0270.mp4;Johnson was the one who escalated everything in Nam.
./origem/partes/parte_0271.mp4;If Kennedy had survived, no way does that escalation continue.
./origem/partes/parte_0272.mp4;Those boys would have lived.
./origem/partes/parte_0273.mp4;Al, I get it.
./origem/partes/parte_0274.mp4;But changing the past to make it how you think it should be just seems...
./origem/partes/parte_0275.mp4;You think Vietnam unfolded exactly as it should have?
./origem/partes/parte_0276.mp4;That recent American history was just hunky dory.
./origem/partes/parte_0277.mp4;That saving JFK is just a theory.
./origem/partes/parte_0278.mp4;You don't know what it's going to change.
./origem/partes/parte_0279.mp4;You know what I know?
./origem/partes/parte_0280.mp4;You save Kennedy's life, you make the world a better place.
./origem/partes/parte_0281.mp4;God damn it.
./origem/partes/parte_0282.mp4;Al.
./origem/partes/parte_0283.mp4;Don't you want to do any fucking thing that matters?
./origem/partes/parte_0284.mp4;I'm just saying you don't have any proof.
./origem/partes/parte_0285.mp4;You don't know that what you do in the past is going to change anything here.
./origem/partes/parte_0286.mp4;Go see.
./origem/partes/parte_0287.mp4;What do you want me to go stab someone?
./origem/partes/parte_0288.mp4;No, Jake.
./origem/partes/parte_0289.mp4;There's a tree out there.
./origem/partes/parte_0290.mp4;Carve something in it.
./origem/partes/parte_0291.mp4;Jesus Christ.
./origem/partes/parte_0292.mp4;God damn it.
./origem/partes/parte_0293.mp4;Fucking god damn.
./origem/partes/parte_0294.mp4;I hate that fucking door.
./origem/partes/parte_0295.mp4;Hey, you come to me.
./origem/partes/parte_0296.mp4;Man, it doesn't matter.
./origem/partes/parte_0297.mp4;You come to me.
./origem/partes/parte_0298.mp4;I hate that fucking door.
./origem/partes/parte_0299.mp4;Shh.
./origem/partes/parte_0300.mp4;All right, I'm gonna show you.
./origem/partes/parte_0301.mp4;We're out of here.
./origem/partes/parte_0302.mp4;You're not getting back in here.
./origem/partes/parte_0303.mp4;Oh, for the love of my life.
./origem/partes/parte_0304.mp4;You shouldn't be here.
./origem/partes/parte_0305.mp4;Back off, okay?
./origem/partes/parte_0306.mp4;Next time you go through,
./origem/partes/parte_0307.mp4;that carving won't be there.
./origem/partes/parte_0309.mp4;Each time you go in,
./origem/partes/parte_0310.mp4;everything resets.
./origem/partes/parte_0311.mp4;It's always 1158 on October 21st, 1960.
./origem/partes/parte_0312.mp4;You saw how everything looked
./origem/partes/parte_0314.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0315.mp4;No matter how long you stay,
./origem/partes/parte_0316.mp4;three weeks, three years,
./origem/partes/parte_0317.mp4;when you come back,
./origem/partes/parte_0318.mp4;only two minutes will have passed here.
./origem/partes/parte_0320.mp4;Who makes up these rules?
./origem/partes/parte_0321.mp4;I'm just explaining that
./origem/partes/parte_0322.mp4;if you want to change something forever,
./origem/partes/parte_0323.mp4;you can't ever go back.
./origem/partes/parte_0324.mp4;Going back erases what you did before.
./origem/partes/parte_0325.mp4;All right, who's the guy with the hat
./origem/partes/parte_0326.mp4;and the yellow card?
./origem/partes/parte_0328.mp4;Well, he got up in my face.
./origem/partes/parte_0329.mp4;I mean, he seemed to be
./origem/partes/parte_0331.mp4;the only one that noticed me come and go.
./origem/partes/parte_0332.mp4;Just forget the yellow card, man.
./origem/partes/parte_0333.mp4;He's not important.
./origem/partes/parte_0334.mp4;What's important
./origem/partes/parte_0335.mp4;is that we have a chance here.
./origem/partes/parte_0336.mp4;A chance to change people's lives.
./origem/partes/parte_0337.mp4;I saw you sitting there with Christie,
./origem/partes/parte_0338.mp4;and I knew you could do this.
./origem/partes/parte_0339.mp4;What are you talking about?
./origem/partes/parte_0340.mp4;That's the last time I went through.
./origem/partes/parte_0342.mp4;about two years.
./origem/partes/parte_0343.mp4;Two years?
./origem/partes/parte_0344.mp4;While I signed my divorce papers?
./origem/partes/parte_0345.mp4;That was...
./origem/partes/parte_0346.mp4;Two minutes.
./origem/partes/parte_0347.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0348.mp4;It doesn't make any sense.
./origem/partes/parte_0349.mp4;It doesn't make any sense.
./origem/partes/parte_0350.mp4;Drake, the way the world is now doesn't make any sense.
./origem/partes/parte_0351.mp4;Just think about it.
./origem/partes/parte_0352.mp4;All right?
./origem/partes/parte_0353.mp4;You know how to think, don't you?
./origem/partes/parte_0354.mp4;Marisol Breslin.
./origem/partes/parte_0355.mp4;Congratulations, Marisol.
./origem/partes/parte_0356.mp4;Hector de la Fuente.
./origem/partes/parte_0357.mp4;That idiot always schedules
./origem/partes/parte_0358.mp4;these goddamn things on a Friday.
./origem/partes/parte_0359.mp4;Maureen Kelly.
./origem/partes/parte_0360.mp4;I can't send diplomas in the mail.
./origem/partes/parte_0361.mp4;How long have you worked here, Alice?
./origem/partes/parte_0362.mp4;I went here.
./origem/partes/parte_0363.mp4;Wow.
./origem/partes/parte_0364.mp4;Gary Dunning.
./origem/partes/parte_0365.mp4;Gary.
./origem/partes/parte_0366.mp4;All right.
./origem/partes/parte_0367.mp4;Harry!
./origem/partes/parte_0368.mp4;He's a great writer.
./origem/partes/parte_0369.mp4;I'll look for his work in the New Yorker.
./origem/partes/parte_0370.mp4;Did you get my recommendation?
./origem/partes/parte_0371.mp4;Listen, you love Harry.
./origem/partes/parte_0372.mp4;I love Harry.
./origem/partes/parte_0373.mp4;We all love Harry.
./origem/partes/parte_0374.mp4;He's great at pushing the group.
./origem/partes/parte_0375.mp4;But at management, making a schedule,
./origem/partes/parte_0376.mp4;signing timesheets?
./origem/partes/parte_0377.mp4;No way.
./origem/partes/parte_0378.mp4;All these graduates are starting new lives.
./origem/partes/parte_0379.mp4;That's it.
./origem/partes/parte_0380.mp4;I'm off the clock.
./origem/partes/parte_0381.mp4;Congratulations!
./origem/partes/parte_0382.mp4;All right!
./origem/partes/parte_0383.mp4;All the best!
./origem/partes/parte_0384.mp4;All right!
./origem/partes/parte_0385.mp4;Congratulations!
./origem/partes/parte_0386.mp4;All the best, George!
./origem/partes/parte_0387.mp4;All right.
./origem/partes/parte_0388.mp4;Tell me more.
./origem/partes/parte_0389.mp4;Come here.
./origem/partes/parte_0390.mp4;Holy shit.
./origem/partes/parte_0391.mp4;I thought you didn't have any hobbies.
./origem/partes/parte_0392.mp4;Who do you think killed Kennedy?
./origem/partes/parte_0393.mp4;People seem to think it was Lee Harvey Oswald.
./origem/partes/parte_0395.mp4;You know, in a conspiracy with the mafia,
./origem/partes/parte_0396.mp4;CIA, FBI, Russians,
./origem/partes/parte_0397.mp4;babushka lady on the grassy knoll.
./origem/partes/parte_0398.mp4;A lot of books written about it.
./origem/partes/parte_0399.mp4;Most of them written about Lee Harvey Oswald.
./origem/partes/parte_0400.mp4;Guy didn't make sense.
./origem/partes/parte_0401.mp4;U.S. Marine,
./origem/partes/parte_0402.mp4;defected to Russia, came back.
./origem/partes/parte_0403.mp4;But everyone who wrote about Oswald
./origem/partes/parte_0404.mp4;studied him after the assassination.
./origem/partes/parte_0405.mp4;I saw him before.
./origem/partes/parte_0406.mp4;I saw him when he came back from Russia.
./origem/partes/parte_0407.mp4;In 1962.
./origem/partes/parte_0408.mp4;What the hell are you staring at?
./origem/partes/parte_0409.mp4;Nothing.
./origem/partes/parte_0410.mp4;Yeah, well, mind your own.
./origem/partes/parte_0411.mp4;Why didn't you shoot him right there?
./origem/partes/parte_0412.mp4;I don't know whether Oswald was the man who did it.
./origem/partes/parte_0413.mp4;I still don't know.
./origem/partes/parte_0414.mp4;I'm not gonna shoot someone because of maybe.
./origem/partes/parte_0415.mp4;There are hundreds of questions that haven't been answered
./origem/partes/parte_0416.mp4;concerning Oswald in that day.
./origem/partes/parte_0417.mp4;This is a big one.
./origem/partes/parte_0418.mp4;Who's this?
./origem/partes/parte_0419.mp4;Walker.
./origem/partes/parte_0420.mp4;Ran for Texas governor.
./origem/partes/parte_0421.mp4;You know that in 1963,
./origem/partes/parte_0422.mp4;six months before Kennedy was shot,
./origem/partes/parte_0423.mp4;there was an assassination attempt on him.
./origem/partes/parte_0424.mp4;There was an assassination attempt on this man.
./origem/partes/parte_0426.mp4;A bullet came from a 6.5 caliber Carcano rifle.
./origem/partes/parte_0427.mp4;Same exact make a gun that killed Kennedy.
./origem/partes/parte_0428.mp4;Well, did you go back and see Oswald shoot Walker?
./origem/partes/parte_0429.mp4;That's what I want you to do.
./origem/partes/parte_0431.mp4;I want you to make it to April 10th, 1963.
./origem/partes/parte_0432.mp4;And if Oswald fires that gun alone,
./origem/partes/parte_0434.mp4;Hold on.
./origem/partes/parte_0435.mp4;What are we even talking about here?
./origem/partes/parte_0436.mp4;We're talking about seeing
./origem/partes/parte_0437.mp4;if Oswald took the gun.
./origem/partes/parte_0438.mp4;Or if he took a shot at Walker.
./origem/partes/parte_0439.mp4;I go back through the rabbit hole.
./origem/partes/parte_0440.mp4;I come out in 1960.
./origem/partes/parte_0441.mp4;You want me to hang out for three years?
./origem/partes/parte_0442.mp4;Two minutes here.
./origem/partes/parte_0443.mp4;What am I gonna do in 1960?
./origem/partes/parte_0444.mp4;I'm nothing there.
./origem/partes/parte_0445.mp4;How am I gonna live?
./origem/partes/parte_0446.mp4;I'm glad you asked.
./origem/partes/parte_0447.mp4;Treasure chest.
./origem/partes/parte_0448.mp4;James Amberson.
./origem/partes/parte_0449.mp4;See, you can still answer to Jake if you want.
./origem/partes/parte_0450.mp4;This is for me.
./origem/partes/parte_0451.mp4;You're welcome.
./origem/partes/parte_0452.mp4;Social Security card, birth certificate,
./origem/partes/parte_0453.mp4;charge cards, everything you need to hold a job,
./origem/partes/parte_0454.mp4;blend in.
./origem/partes/parte_0456.mp4;When did you do this?
./origem/partes/parte_0457.mp4;When I got diagnosed in 1962.
./origem/partes/parte_0458.mp4;You made all this when you were back there?
./origem/partes/parte_0459.mp4;Here's the most important thing.
./origem/partes/parte_0460.mp4;Sports stats?
./origem/partes/parte_0461.mp4;Yeah, baseball and boxing mostly.
./origem/partes/parte_0462.mp4;This is how you survived?
./origem/partes/parte_0463.mp4;You spent all your time back there gambling?
./origem/partes/parte_0464.mp4;That and there was a butcher I liked on Main Street.
./origem/partes/parte_0465.mp4;How do you think I keep my prices here so low?
./origem/partes/parte_0466.mp4;That's what you've been feeding me?
./origem/partes/parte_0467.mp4;I've been eating hamburgers from 1960?
./origem/partes/parte_0468.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0469.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0470.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0471.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0472.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0473.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0474.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0475.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0476.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0477.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0478.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0479.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0480.mp4;I don't know who you think I am.
./origem/partes/parte_0481.mp4;I just don't think I'm the right guy for this.
./origem/partes/parte_0482.mp4;devociation
./origem/partes/parte_0483.mp4;Yeah, yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0484.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0485.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0486.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0487.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0488.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0489.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0490.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0491.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0492.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0493.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0494.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0495.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0496.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0497.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0498.mp4;Let's go.
./origem/partes/parte_0499.mp4;Go where?
./origem/partes/parte_0500.mp4;To the diner.
./origem/partes/parte_0501.mp4;I'll watch you go through.
./origem/partes/parte_0502.mp4;I can wait two minutes.
./origem/partes/parte_0503.mp4;Two minutes to get a better world.
./origem/partes/parte_0504.mp4;I have to think about all this.
./origem/partes/parte_0505.mp4;What's there to think about?
./origem/partes/parte_0506.mp4;I don't know.
./origem/partes/parte_0507.mp4;Okay.
./origem/partes/parte_0508.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0509.mp4;Oh, yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0510.mp4;And what a waste of fucking time.
./origem/partes/parte_0511.mp4;What?
./origem/partes/parte_0512.mp4;Now I can see how this is gonna go.
./origem/partes/parte_0513.mp4;Oh, my car needs an oil change.
./origem/partes/parte_0514.mp4;Gotta give a big test.
./origem/partes/parte_0515.mp4;Gotta go take a nap.
./origem/partes/parte_0516.mp4;Anything to avoid doing something real in your life.
./origem/partes/parte_0517.mp4;I've been up all night listening to fucking crazy.
./origem/partes/parte_0518.mp4;I thought maybe for once.
./origem/partes/parte_0519.mp4;This is fucking crazy.
./origem/partes/parte_0520.mp4;You might do something, not just talk about it.
./origem/partes/parte_0521.mp4;Just because you wasted your life on this,
./origem/partes/parte_0522.mp4;it doesn't mean that I have to.
./origem/partes/parte_0523.mp4;You little shit.
./origem/partes/parte_0524.mp4;Get the fuck out of my house.
./origem/partes/parte_0525.mp4;Get out.
./origem/partes/parte_0526.mp4;Get the fuck out of my house.
./origem/partes/parte_0527.mp4;Get the fuck out of my house.
./origem/partes/parte_0528.mp4;I'm not an angel.
./origem/partes/parte_0529.mp4;I know that it's for the value of life,
./origem/partes/parte_0530.mp4;but if I just leave you,
./origem/partes/parte_0531.mp4;my life will continue to be the life I was meant to have been.
./origem/partes/parte_0532.mp4;What's your problem with knowing the truth about life?
./origem/partes/parte_0533.mp4;The only thing saya doesn't care about is if you'd have a favorite or upset life.
./origem/partes/parte_0534.mp4;How many girlfriends did you date?
./origem/partes/parte_0535.mp4;I hated krieps.
./origem/partes/parte_0536.mp4;I didn't wanna have guys.
./origem/partes/parte_0537.mp4;I couldn't have any.
./origem/partes/parte_0538.mp4;Couldn't sleep.
./origem/partes/parte_0539.mp4;Out.
./origem/partes/parte_0540.mp4;Shit.
./origem/partes/parte_0541.mp4;Out.
./origem/partes/parte_0542.mp4;Okay, buddy.
./origem/partes/parte_0543.mp4;See you in two minutes.
./origem/partes/parte_0544.mp4;Here I go.
./origem/partes/parte_0545.mp4;Careful.
./origem/partes/parte_0546.mp4;Shouldn't be here.
./origem/partes/parte_0547.mp4;I'm telling you.
./origem/partes/parte_0548.mp4;You shouldn't be here.
./origem/partes/parte_0549.mp4;Well, I'm here.
./origem/partes/parte_0550.mp4;I'm here.
./origem/partes/parte_0551.mp4;I'm here.
./origem/partes/parte_0552.mp4;I'm here.
./origem/partes/parte_0553.mp4;Like, come on.
./origem/partes/parte_0554.mp4;Come on.
./origem/partes/parte_0555.mp4;Let's dance.
./origem/partes/parte_0556.mp4;Come on.
./origem/partes/parte_0557.mp4;Come on.
./origem/partes/parte_0558.mp4;Come on.
./origem/partes/parte_0559.mp4;Come on.
./origem/partes/parte_0560.mp4;Come on.
./origem/partes/parte_0561.mp4;Come on.
./origem/partes/parte_0562.mp4;You need to blend in, so get your hair cut and get rid of the stuff on your face.
./origem/partes/parte_0563.mp4;It's not going to work.
./origem/partes/parte_0564.mp4;Looks like you're overdue.
./origem/partes/parte_0565.mp4;Yeah, I guess so.
./origem/partes/parte_0566.mp4;You're out of town?
./origem/partes/parte_0567.mp4;Uh, yes. James Amberson.
./origem/partes/parte_0568.mp4;Amberson?
./origem/partes/parte_0569.mp4;Those the Ambersons over in Castle Rock?
./origem/partes/parte_0571.mp4;I know my wife's cousin married an Amberson, but he was from New Hampshire.
./origem/partes/parte_0572.mp4;Those your people?
./origem/partes/parte_0573.mp4;Actually, I was adopted.
./origem/partes/parte_0575.mp4;Get the right clothes.
./origem/partes/parte_0576.mp4;Back then, grown men wore suits and hats.
./origem/partes/parte_0577.mp4;When I vote, it comes down to character.
./origem/partes/parte_0578.mp4;Richard Nixon has it.
./origem/partes/parte_0579.mp4;You look at him.
./origem/partes/parte_0580.mp4;You think that's a good man.
./origem/partes/parte_0581.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0582.mp4;Perfect. Cash or credit, sir?
./origem/partes/parte_0583.mp4;Oh, uh, cash.
./origem/partes/parte_0584.mp4;Uh, can I have a hat, too, please?
./origem/partes/parte_0586.mp4;Thanks.
./origem/partes/parte_0588.mp4;Hey.
./origem/partes/parte_0589.mp4;Hey.
./origem/partes/parte_0590.mp4;Hey.
./origem/partes/parte_0591.mp4;I guess you liked it.
./origem/partes/parte_0592.mp4;That is the best pie that I've ever had.
./origem/partes/parte_0593.mp4;It's insane.
./origem/partes/parte_0594.mp4;Um, I hope that's a good thing.
./origem/partes/parte_0595.mp4;Yeah. Yeah. Insanely good.
./origem/partes/parte_0596.mp4;It'll be 60 cents.
./origem/partes/parte_0597.mp4;60 cents. Okay.
./origem/partes/parte_0598.mp4;Of course.
./origem/partes/parte_0599.mp4;Hey, keep the change.
./origem/partes/parte_0600.mp4;Oh, thank you.
./origem/partes/parte_0601.mp4;Tell my mother you like her pie, Mr...
./origem/partes/parte_0602.mp4;Mr. Amberson. Yeah, thank you.
./origem/partes/parte_0604.mp4;You're Alice. Oh, my God.
./origem/partes/parte_0605.mp4;Something the matter?
./origem/partes/parte_0606.mp4;Did you go to South Lisbon High?
./origem/partes/parte_0607.mp4;Yeah, I just graduated.
./origem/partes/parte_0608.mp4;And you're going to teach there, right?
./origem/partes/parte_0609.mp4;Heck no. After the summer, I'm moving to Bangor.
./origem/partes/parte_0610.mp4;And then after that, New York.
./origem/partes/parte_0611.mp4;My mother doesn't know yet.
./origem/partes/parte_0612.mp4;Right. Well, good luck with that.
./origem/partes/parte_0614.mp4;Do me a favor. Just try to stay sweet.
./origem/partes/parte_0615.mp4;Okay. Maybe I'll see you around.
./origem/partes/parte_0616.mp4;I can laugh when things ain't funny.
./origem/partes/parte_0617.mp4;I can laugh when I'm lucky.
./origem/partes/parte_0618.mp4;Yeah, I can smile when I ain't got no money.
./origem/partes/parte_0619.mp4;I can laugh when I'm happy.
./origem/partes/parte_0621.mp4;Get a neutral, reliable, boring car.
./origem/partes/parte_0622.mp4;There's a lot on Maple Street.
./origem/partes/parte_0623.mp4;I got a deal on a 54 Chevy.
./origem/partes/parte_0624.mp4;Need to make your money last.
./origem/partes/parte_0625.mp4;You a buyer or a looker?
./origem/partes/parte_0626.mp4;Looker.
./origem/partes/parte_0627.mp4;Honey of a car.
./origem/partes/parte_0629.mp4;You know, this thing drives like a horse of fire.
./origem/partes/parte_0630.mp4;I bet.
./origem/partes/parte_0631.mp4;Bought it from Arlene Keegan over in Durham after her husband died.
./origem/partes/parte_0632.mp4;From out of town, am I right?
./origem/partes/parte_0633.mp4;Yeah.
./origem/partes/parte_0634.mp4;Andy Carson.
./origem/partes/parte_0635.mp4;Jake Amberson.
./origem/partes/parte_0636.mp4;So how much?
./origem/partes/parte_0639.mp4;750?
./origem/partes/parte_0640.mp4;Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
./origem/partes/parte_0641.mp4;What would you say if, uh, it's 650?
./origem/partes/parte_0642.mp4;Cash.
./origem/partes/parte_0643.mp4;Mr. Amberson, make it seven.
./origem/partes/parte_0644.mp4;You got yourself a deal.
./origem/partes/parte_0646.mp4;Young lady in the office will write the sale up for you.
./origem/partes/parte_0647.mp4;I'll put on a sticker and a 14-day plate.
./origem/partes/parte_0648.mp4;Sticker will be another $5.
./origem/partes/parte_0649.mp4;All right.
./origem/partes/parte_0650.mp4;You got me.
./origem/partes/parte_0652.mp4;Uh, hey, Andy.
./origem/partes/parte_0654.mp4;It kind of cleans me out.
./origem/partes/parte_0655.mp4;Happen to know any place around here a guy might place a bet?
./origem/partes/parte_0656.mp4;A little more than a friendly wager?
./origem/partes/parte_0657.mp4;It may sound silly, but...
./origem/partes/parte_0658.mp4;I don't...
./origem/partes/parte_0659.mp4;I got the moonlight, I got the sun, I've got the stars above.
./origem/partes/parte_0660.mp4;Me and my filly, well, we both share.
./origem/partes/parte_0661.mp4;Slappy go happy, happy go lucky.
./origem/partes/parte_0662.mp4;Love, well, life is sweet.
./origem/partes/parte_0663.mp4;Oh, yeah, sweet and honey.
./origem/partes/parte_0664.mp4;Happy go lucky me.
./origem/partes/parte_0665.mp4;Happy go lucky me.
./origem/partes/parte_0666.mp4;Happy go lucky me.
./origem/partes/parte_0667.mp4;I'm gonna be here for a while.
./origem/partes/parte_0668.mp4;What are you looking to make a bet on?
./origem/partes/parte_0669.mp4;Fight of the week, Sanchez versus Joffrey.
./origem/partes/parte_0670.mp4;Joffrey to win.
./origem/partes/parte_0671.mp4;Three to one on us.
./origem/partes/parte_0672.mp4;Three to one, that's it?
./origem/partes/parte_0674.mp4;Want to make it interesting?
./origem/partes/parte_0677.mp4;What if I said, uh, Joffrey will knock him out in six rounds?
./origem/partes/parte_0678.mp4;Uh, I'd say 35 to one.
./origem/partes/parte_0679.mp4;Wow.
./origem/partes/parte_0680.mp4;35 to one.
./origem/partes/parte_0681.mp4;Hell, I'll make that bet.
./origem/partes/parte_0682.mp4;Eddie, I'm gonna take 35 to one.
./origem/partes/parte_0684.mp4;Okay.
./origem/partes/parte_0685.mp4;You got a bet?
./origem/partes/parte_0686.mp4;Oh, yeah?
./origem/partes/parte_0688.mp4;Great.
./origem/partes/parte_0689.mp4;Uh, how about, uh, $100?
./origem/partes/parte_0690.mp4;$100.
./origem/partes/parte_0691.mp4;$100.
./origem/partes/parte_0692.mp4;$100.
./origem/partes/parte_0693.mp4;$100.
./origem/partes/parte_0694.mp4;$100.
./origem/partes/parte_0695.mp4;Or...
./origem/partes/parte_0696.mp4;Or...
./origem/partes/parte_0697.mp4;Or...
./origem/partes/parte_0698.mp4;Or...
./origem/partes/parte_0699.mp4;Yeah.
