And afterwards, we spoke right after that. We spoke very sincerely. I think he wants to see it done. I wanna see if we can get it done. You know, it's still it's not a done deal at all. They're gonna set up a meeting now between president Zelensky and president Putin and myself, I guess. You know? I didn't even I didn't ask you about it. Not that I wanna be there, but I wanna make sure it gets done. And we agreed on a lot of points. I mean, a lot of points we agreed on. But there's not that much. There's, you know, one or two pretty significant items, but I think they can be reached. Now it's really up to president Zelensky to get it done. And, I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit. There's gonna be some land swaps. There will be more Russian territory than there had been. And what Ukraine wants and needs desperately is our security measures that won't be NATO related. If you had to look into your crystal ball, is that how it ends? Well, I think those are points that we negotiated, and those are points that we largely have agreed on, actually. I think we're pretty close to it. Yeah. Now look. Ukraine has to agree to it. Maybe they'll say no. India doesn't buy your oil. The European Union won't buy it. And why in the back of my head was I thinking, wait a minute. Donald Trump just delayed possible, possible increase in tariffs on China. Why do I think that probably president Trump was thinking ahead that maybe if you had to, that would have been part of the consequences? Well, because of what happened today, I think I don't have to think about that. Now I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don't have to think about that right now. I think the, you know, the meeting went very well. It's a historic day, and I know that",

You know, it's still it's not a done deal at all.\n\nThey're gonna set up a meeting now between president Zelensky and president Putin and myself, I guess. You know? I didn't even I didn't ask you about it. Not that I wanna be there, but I wanna make sure it gets done. And we agreed on a lot of points.\n\nI mean, a lot of points we agreed on. But there's not that much. There's, you know, one or two pretty significant items, but I think they can be reached. Now it's really up to president Zelensky to get it done. And, I would also say the European nations, they have to get involved a little bit.\n\nThere's gonna be some land swaps. There will be more Russian territory than there had been. And what Ukraine wants and needs desperately is our security measures that won't be NATO related. If you had to look into your crystal ball, is that how it ends? Well, I think those are points that we negotiated, and those are points that we largely have agreed on, actually.\n\nI think we're pretty close to it. Yeah. Now look. Ukraine has to agree to it. Maybe they'll say no.\n\nIndia doesn't buy your oil. The European Union won't buy it. And why in the back of my head was I thinking, wait a minute. Donald Trump just delayed possible, possible increase in tariffs on China. Why do I think that probably president Trump was thinking ahead that maybe if you had to, that would have been part of the consequences?\n\nWell, because of what happened today, I think I don't have to think about that. Now I may have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks or something, but we don't have to think about that right now. I think the, you know, the meeting went very well.
